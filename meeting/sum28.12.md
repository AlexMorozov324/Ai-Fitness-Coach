What we discussed
We aligned on the **core edge (unique value)** of our AI Fitness Coach 
project.

## Key decision: project edge & main feature
Our main differentiator will be a **real-time exercise tracking and form 
validation feature**:

- Track the user while they perform exercises.
- Detect whether movements are being executed correctly.
- Provide **instant corrections** when the form is wrong (e.g., posture, 
range of motion, timing).
- Provide **motivation and encouragement** when needed to help the user 
stay consistent.

This feature will be the **central pillar** of the project.

## Next steps
To move forward, we need to validate the foundation of the system:

- Ensure our tracking mechanism works reliably and can **follow the user’s 
body/pose** consistently.
- Confirm it can accurately detect and monitor the **specific exercises** 
the user performs.
- Once tracking is stable, we will iterate on:
  - form-correction logic
  - feedback/motivation messages
  - overall coaching flow
