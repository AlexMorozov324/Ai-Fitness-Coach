Our project is an autonomous AI fitness coach that provides real-time feedback during workouts and builds a personalized training plan. Instead of only logging reps, it continuously evaluates how the user is moving and performing, detects signs of fatigue or unsafe technique, and intervenes immediately with guidance (e.g., adjust form, stop the set, reduce intensity). In parallel, it acts as a motivational coach: it adapts its encouragement to the user’s personality and goals, knows when to push, when to slow down, and uses progress milestones to keep the user engaged and consistent. Based on each session’s performance and adherence, it updates the next workouts to match the user’s current level and needs.
